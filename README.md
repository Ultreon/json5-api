# json5-java
This is a reference implementation of the JSON5 standard in Java 11+, capable of parsing and serialization of JSON5 data.

This library is an enhanced version of [Synt4xErr0r4 / json5](https://github.com/Synt4xErr0r4/json5), which provides a better full-fledged API inspired by the [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) library.
